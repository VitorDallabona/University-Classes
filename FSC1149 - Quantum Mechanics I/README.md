# FSC1149 - Quantum Mechanics I

This course covers the foundations of quantum mechanics, including its historical origins and the core quantum formalism, with emphasis on the postulates of states, measurement, and quantum dynamics. It examines the uncertainty relations and the quantum description of position, linear momentum, and angular momentum. The course explores simple quantum systems such as two-level systems, the quantum harmonic oscillator, potential barriers, and quantum tunneling. It also addresses central potentials and provides a detailed study of the hydrogen atom.
