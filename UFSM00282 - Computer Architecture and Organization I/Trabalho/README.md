# Binary Search Tree in MIPS Assembly

Using the MipsIt development environment, this work addresses Assembly programming for the MIPS processor. Based on the provided ```BinarySearchTree.c``` function, three routines were migrated to assembly language. The original functions ```CreateStudent```, ```RemoveStudent```, and ```Insert_r``` were replaced by their Assembly implementations ```CreateStudent_asm```, ```RemoveStudent_asm```, and ```Insert_r_asm```, ensuring interoperability between C and Assembly code.
