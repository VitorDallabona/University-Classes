# UFSM00282 - Computer Architecture and Organization I

This course covers the fundamentals of computer organization and operation, including basic programming tools such as assemblers, compilers, and linkers. It introduces instruction formats, register sets, addressing modes, and core architectural paradigms, including accumulator-based and load–store architectures. The relationship between high-level programming languages and assembly language is explored, along with assembly code construction, subroutine calls, and stack operation. Performance analysis is addressed through instruction count, execution time, and cycles per instruction (CPI). The course also examines the data path and control unit, detailing cycle-by-cycle instruction execution, instruction decoding, and control signal generation. Finally, it introduces floating-point representation and arithmetic following the IEEE 754 standard, including scientific notation and floating-point instructions.
