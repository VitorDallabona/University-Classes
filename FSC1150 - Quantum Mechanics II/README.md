#  FSC1150 - Quantum Mechanics II

This course introduces time-independent approximation methods in quantum mechanics, including the Hamiltonian formulation for perturbative interactions and perturbation theory for stationary states with discrete spectra. It covers the Ritz variational method and the semiclassical (WKB) approximation. Time-dependent approximation methods are also discussed. The course further explores relativistic quantum mechanics, focusing on the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, as well as the fundamentals of quantum scattering theory.
